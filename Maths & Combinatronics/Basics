A number is even if it is divisible by 2, i.e., n % 2 == 0; otherwise, it is odd.
Floor of a number gives the greatest integer less than or equal to it.
Example: floor(3.8) = 3
Ceil gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.
Example: ceil(3.2) = 4
The sum of the first n natural numbers is: Sum = (n(n+1))/2​
The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers a and b is the largest number that divides both.
Found using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,a%b)
The LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest number that is divisible by both a and b.
Formula: lcm(a,b)= (a x b)/ gcd(a,b)
A number is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
Example: 6 → divisors: 1, 2, 3 → sum = 6
To find factors of a number n, iterate from 1 to √n and check n % i == 0. Store both i and n/i.
Decimal to binary conversion: divide the number by 2 repeatedly, store remainders, and reverse them.
